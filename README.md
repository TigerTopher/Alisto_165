# Alisto 165



Project Description
---
```
Alisto is both a mobile and a web app that aims to secure the safety
of its users by promoting real-world awareness. First, its mobile app
informs the user about the crime notoriety on the userâ€™s current
location. This may through beeps and vibrations. Also, in just a click
of a button, the user can send distress signals with his emergency-
contact persons. Second, its web app allows the user to view and to
report crimes on selected areas. Partnered with the right authorities,
this crowdsourced app will not only react to crimes, but will help
prevent it.
